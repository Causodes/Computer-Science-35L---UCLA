1. The patch should improve performance as it removes an if statement that is present in the pre-patched version.

2. Any other scripts that rely on the fuctionality of "ls" may have errors if they relied on the previous functionality of the command.

3. An index error occurs as the function relies on the number of lines in the file, being 0 for an empty file.

4. There is a syntax error when running the function with python3 as opposed to python as IOError behaves differently in python2 than python3.
