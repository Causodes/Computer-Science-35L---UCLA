Exercise 1.1: Moving around in Emacs

    1. Use Emacs to edit the file exer1.html.
		C-x C-f e x e r 1 . h t m l Enter
		
    2. Move the cursor to just after the first occurrence of the word "HTML" (all upper-case).
		C-s H T M L Enter
		
    3. Now move the cursor to the start of the first later occurrence of the word "scavenger".
		C-s s c a v e n g e r Enter M-b
		
    4. Now move the cursor to the start of the first later occurrence of the word 		"self-referential".
		C-s s e l f - r e f e r e n t i a l Enter M-b M-b
		
    5. Now move the cursor to the start of the first later occurrence of the word "arrow".
		C-s a r r o w Enter M-b
		
    6. Now move the cursor to the end of the current line.
		C-e
		
    7. Now move the cursor to the beginning of the current line.
		C-a
		
    8. Doing the above tasks with the arrow keys takes many keystrokes, or it involves holding down keys for a long time. Can you think of a way to do it with fewer keystrokes by using some of the commands available in Emacs?
		C-e moves to the end of the current line and C-a moves to the beginning of the current line.
		
    9. Did you move the cursor using the arrow keys? If so, repeat the above steps, without using the arrow keys.
		no
		
    10. When you are done, exit Emacs.
		C-x C-c y

Exercise 1.2: Deleting text in Emacs

    1. Use Emacs to edit the file exer2.html. The idea is to delete its HTML comments; the resulting page should display the same text as the original.
		C-x C-f e x e r 2 . h t m l Enter
		
    2. Delete the 18th line, which is an HTML comment. <!-- HTML comments look like this. -->
		C-s < ! - - Enter C-a C-k
		
    3. Delete the HTML comment containing the text "DELETE-ME DELETE-ME DELETE-ME".
		C-s D E L E T E Enter C-a C-k
		
    4. Delete the HTML comment containing the text "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_comment#Comments".
		C-s < ! - - Enter C-a C-k C-n C-k C-n C-k
		
    5. There are three more HTML comments; delete them too.
		C-s < ! - - Enter C-b C-b C-b Delete Delete Delete Delete Delete Delete Delete C-n C-a C-k C-k C-k C-k C-k C-k C-k C-s < ! - - Enter C-a C-k
		
Exercise 1.3: Inserting text in Emacs

    1. Use Emacs to edit the file exer3.html.
		C-x C-f e x e r 3 . h t m l Enter
		
    2. Change the first two instances of "Assignment 1" to "Assignment 42".
		C-s A s s i g n m e n t Space 1 Enter Backspace 4 2 C-s A s s i g n m e n t Space 1 Enter Backspace 4 2
		
    3. Change the first instance of "UTF-8" to "US-ASCII".
		M-< C-s U T F - 8 Enter Backspace Backspace Backspace Backspace S - A S C I I
		
    4. Ooops! The file is not ASCII so you need to fix that. Remove every line containing a non-ASCII character. You can find the next non-ASCII character by searching for the regular expression [^[:ascii:]].
		C-M-s [ ^ [ : a s c i i : ] ] Enter C-a C-k
	
    5. Insert an empty line after the first line containing "</ol>".
    When you finish, save the text file and exit Emacs. As before, use the diff command to check your work.
		M-< C-s < / o l > Enter Enter C-x C-c y
		
Exercise 1.4: Other editing tasks in Emacs6

    1. Execute the command "cat exer2.html exer2.diff >exer4.html" to create a file exer4.html that contains a copy of exer2.html followed by a copy of exer2.diff.
		
    2. Use Emacs to edit the file exer4.html. The idea is to edit the file so that it looks identical to exer1.html on a browser, but the file itself is a little bit different internally.
	
    3. Go to the end of the file. Copy the new lines in the last chunk of diff output, and paste them into the correct location earlier in the file.
		M-> C-r - < C-f C-@ C-e C-w M-g g 3 9 8 Enter C-y
		
    4. Repeat the process, until the earlier part of the file is identical to what was in the original.
		
		
    5. Delete the last part of the file, which contains the diff output.
    6. â€¦ except we didn't really want to do that, so undo the deletion.
    7. Turn the diff output into a comment, by surrounding it with "<!--" and "-->".
    8. Now let's try some search and replaces. Search the text document for the pattern "<ol>". How many instances did you find? Use the search and replace function to replace them all with the final-caps equivalent "<oL>".
    9. Check your work with viewing exer4.html with an HTML browser, and by running the shell command "diff -u exer1.html exer4.html >exer4.diff". The only differences should be changes from "<ol>" to "<oL>", and a long HTML comment at the end.
