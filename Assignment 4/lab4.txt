Extracting coreutils:
wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall18/cs35L/assign/coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

Changing directories into unzipped location:
cd coreutils-with-bug

Configuring path and compiling:
./configure --prefix=/u/ma/ugrad/yet/CS35L/Assignment4/install
make

This yields the following error:

In file included from utimecmp.c:41:0:
utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
 int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
     ^
In file included from utimecmp.h:25:0,
                 from utimecmp.c:25:
/usr/include/sys/stat.h:373:12: note: previous declaration of 'futimens' was here
 extern int futimens (int __fd, const struct timespec __times[2]) __THROW;
            ^
make[3]: *** [utimecmp.o] Error 1

make[1]: Leaving directory `/w/home.16/ma/ugrad/yet/CS35L/Assignment4/coreutils-with-bug'
make: *** [all] Error 2

The error is thrown as there exist two functions with the same name.

To patch the error I download the patch:
wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall18/cs35L/assign/coreutils.diff

Moving patch into folder and applying:
patch -p0 < coreutils.diff
make

The compilation is successful as one of the coreutils_futimens was renamed to coreutils_tee.
make install

Creating a temp directory per the lab instructions:
tmp=$(mktemp -d)
cd $tmp
touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
touch now
sleep 1
touch now1
TZ=UTCO ~/CS35L/Assignment4/install/bin/ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

This outputs the following:
-rw-r--r-- 1 yet maugrad 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 yet maugrad 0 2018-11-05 05:44:36.484390313 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 yet maugrad 0 2018-11-05 05:44:28.501120294 +0000 now

Continuing the instructions:
cd
rm -fr $tmp

We see that the wwi-armistice file is in the wrong location; it should be at the bottom as it is the oldest file.

Entering gdb to search for cause of error:

gdb ~/CS35L/Assignment4/install/bin/ls
help all
break compare_mtime
run -lt
stepi
list

We see that the incorrect time calculation results from integer overflow. To patch this issue we perform the following:

Changing directories back to location of buggy coreutils:
cd CS35L/Assignment4/coreutils-with-bug/

Creating a copy of the bad function:
cp lib/timespec.h patch

Editing the function:
emacs patch

Changing the subtraction operation to a direct comparison:

timespec_cmp (struct timespec a, struct timespec b)
{
  if(a.tv_sec < b.tv_sec)
        return -1;
  else if(a.tv_sec > b.tv_sec)
        return 1;
  else
        return 0;
}

Creating patch file:
diff -u lib/timespec.h patch > lab4.diff

Testing in an aribitrary nontemp directory:

touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
touch now
sleep 1
touch now1
TZ=UTCO ~/CS35L/Assignment4/install/bin/ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

This yields the following:
-rw-r--r-- 1 yet maugrad 0 2054-12-17 17:28:16.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistice
-rw-r--r-- 1 yet maugrad 0 2018-11-05 06:53:33.943683000 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 yet maugrad 0 2018-11-05 06:53:28.631186000 +0000 now

This returns the correct order of the files.
