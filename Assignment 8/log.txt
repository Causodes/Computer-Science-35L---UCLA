Logging onto Beaglebone as root:
ssh root@192.168.7.1

Finish updating and installing:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xauth
sudo apt-get install xvfb
sudo apt-get install firefox-esr-l10n-en-gb
sudo apt-get install xterm

Install openssh server and openssh client
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Create account for partner:
sudo useradd -d /home/ryang -m ryang
sudo passwd ryang

Creating an .ssh directory within the directory:
cd /home/ryang
sudo mkdir .ssh

Change ownership on ssh directory:
sudo chown -R ryang .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Generate RSA key using defaults, stored in .ssh/id_rsa
ssh-keygen

Following steps are performed on local computer:

Create another private, public key pair
ssh-keygen

Upload private key to server:
ssh-copy-id -i yet@10.97.85.172

Add private key to ssh-agent:
ssh add

Logging in, not password or passphrase required:
ssh yet@10.97.85.172

Test ssh X forwarding:
sudo ssh -Y yet@10.97.85.172

For port forwarding, the difference between ssh-x and ssh-y is that ssh -X is treated as an untrusted client whilst ssh -Y is treated as trusted. Hence, for performance ssh -X limited parts of xterm whilst ssh -Y did not. Thus, if ForwardX11Trusted is set to No, ssh -X does not work while ssh -Y does work due to ssh -Y being treated as a trusted client.
