To change locale to "C" use the following command:
	export LC_ALL='C'

Sorting words and outputting it into a file:
	touch words
	sort /usr/share/dict/words > words
	
To get the text file use the following:
	wget https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall18/cs35L/assign/assign2.html
	mv assign2.html assign2.txt
	
tr -c 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt
	This command outputs lines containing only alphebetical characters; any non alphabetical character is subsequently replaced with a \n.

tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt
	Similar to the above command, except this one only outputs one instance of repeated characters.
	
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort
	This command additionally sorts the output
	
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u
	This command removes all repeated phrases, in addition to sorting the output
	
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u | comm - words
	This command parses the previous output from tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u and has an output of three columns:
		Column 1 contains words unique to assign2.txt
		Column 2 contains words unique to words
		Column 3 contains words that are found in both files
		
tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.txt | sort -u | comm -23 - words
	This command instead only outputs the first column in comparison to the previous command.
	
To download the Hawaiian Dictionary:
	wget http://mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdseng.html
	
To build the bash script:

	#!/bin/bash
	
	# remove space before every line
	sed '^s/^[[:blank:]]*//g' |
	
	# find all matches with opening and closing td tags and list on one line
	grep -E "<td>.+<\/td>" |
	
	# deletes all english translations via deleting every odd line
	sed -n '1~2!p'
	
	# remove every instance of "<u>"
	sed 's/<u>//g' |
	
	# remove every instance of "</u>"
	sed 's/<\/u>//g' |
	
	# remove every instance of "<td>"
	sed 's/<td>//g' |
	
	# remove every instance of "</td>"
	sed 's/<\/td>//g' |
	
	# convert all upper to lower
	tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' |
	
	# replace spaces and commas with \n
	tr ' ,' '\n' |
	
	# replace all backticks with apostrohpe
	sed "s/\`/\'/g" |
	
	# remove any lines containing non hawaiian characters
	sed "/[^pk\'mnwlhaeiou]/d" |
	
	# remove any lines that still contain blanks
	sed '/^$/d' |
	
	# sort remaining lines, removing any duplicates
	sort -u
	
To give user permission to run the script:
	chmod u+x
	
Create the Hawaiian Dictionary
	cat hwnwdseng.htm | ./buildwords > hwords
	
Modifying the last command such that it checks the spelling of Hawaiian instead:
    cat foo.html bar.html | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -cs "pk\'mnwlhaeiou" '[\n*]' | sort -u |  comm -23 - hwords > wrongHawaii
	
Then by running the following command we are able to check number of incorrectly spelled words:
	tr '[:upper:][:lower:] < assign2.txt | tr -cs "pk\'mnwlhaeiou'" '[\n*]' | sort -u|c\ omm -23 -hwords > wrongHawaii
	
	This yields 198 mispelled Hawaiian words from the command:
		wc -| wrongHawaii

By running the following command we find the number of mispelled Hawaiian words that are correctly spelled in English:
	cat wrongHawaii | sort -u | comm -12 - words > correctEnglish
	
	This yields 108 words:
		wc -l correctEnglish
		
		Examples of words mispelled in Hawaiian but not English: "mail, how, keep"
		
By running the following command we find the number of mispelled English words that are correctly spelled in Hawaiian:
	tr -cs 'A-Za-z' '[\n*]' < assign2.html | sort -u | comm -23 - words > wrongEnglish
	cat wrongEnglish | sort -u | comm -12 -hwords > correctHawaiian
	wc -l correctHawaiian
	
	This yields 3 words: halau, wiki, and lau
